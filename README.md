### Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing HR data using Power BI to provide insights into employee demographics and geographical distribution. By leveraging Power BI's powerful visualization tools, including map visualizations, this project demonstrates how data can be transformed into actionable insights for decision-makers.

### Data Sources

The data for this analysis comes from the **HR data.xlxs** file, which was freely downloaded from **Kaggle.com**.

---

### Data Cleaning and Preparations

Before conducting my analysis, I performed data cleaning and preparation to ensure the dataset was accurate and well-structured for visualization.

#### Steps Taken:

**Data Quality Check**

- Utilized Power BIâ€™s column quality, column profile, and column distribution features to identify missing values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies.
Confirmed that all data fields were filled with consistent and reliable values.

**Data Cleaning**

- Designated the first row of the HR data as the header to properly format the dataset.
- Eliminated unnecessary columns and standardized the formatting of location data.
  
**Consistency Check**

- Verified the consistency of categorical fields (such as Department and Gender) to ensure reliable analysis.

### Key Areas of Focus:

### HR Data Analysis:
- Visualizations related to employee demographics, including:
  
1. Age
2. Gender
3. Department Distribution
   
- Identifying trends within the workforce that help organizations understand their employees better.

  
### Geographical Data Mapping:
- Using location data to map employee distribution across different cities or countries.
- Visualizing where employees are concentrated, which departments are represented in each region, and more.

---

### Dataset Description
The dataset includes HR data such as:

1. Employee Details: Age, Gender, Department, Job Role
2. Location Data: City, Country
3. Departmental Information: Employee distribution across different departments

---

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves understanding the data and extracting initial insights to guide further analysis. Based on my dataset, I explored the following key questions:

1. What is the gender distribution of employees?

- Analyzing the gender composition across departments and roles.
  
2. What is the age distribution of employees?

- Identifying the age range within the organization and across various job roles.

3. How are employees distributed across departments?

- Determining which departments have the highest and lowest employee counts.

4. What is the geographical distribution of employees?

- Mapping employee locations to identify geographical patterns.

5. Which department has the highest representation in different regions?

- Understanding departmental dominance across various locations.

6. What is the distribution of job roles within the company?

- Analyzing the prevalence of different job roles.

7. Are there noticeable trends in employee demographics by location?

- Exploring whether certain demographics (like gender or age) are more prominent in specific areas.
