### Project Overview

In this project, I analyzed employee attrition and satisfaction data to identify critical trends within a company’s workforce. My goal was to understand the main drivers behind employee attrition, measure employee satisfaction across various departments, and explore how business travel, job roles, and other factors affect these outcomes. The insights generated provide actionable recommendations for improving employee retention and engagement.

### Data Sources

The data for this analysis comes from the **HR data.xlxs** file, which was freely downloaded from **Kaggle.com**.

---

### Tools Used:

For this project, I leveraged the following tools:
1. **Power BI**: Data visualization and dashboard creation.
   
2. **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: Performed advanced calculations, including attrition rate, average age by department, and satisfaction scores.
   
3. **Excel**: Initial data cleaning and exploration.
  
4. **Power Query**: Used for data transformation and ensuring data consistency.

5. **Github**: Used for portfolio building.

### Data Cleaning and Preparations

The dataset I worked with was clean and consistent, requiring minimal preprocessing. Using **Power BI’s column profiling tools** (*Column Quality, Column Distribution, and Column Profile*), I ensured the dataset was free from missing or erroneous values. These tools verified that the data was 100% consistent, allowing me to dive directly into the analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involves understanding the data and extracting initial insights to guide further analysis. Based on my dataset, I explored the following key questions:

- How many employees rarely travel for business?

- What is the attrition rate across departments, and which department has the highest?
 
- How does business travel frequency affect attrition?
 
- What is the average employee age by department?
 
- What is the overall satisfaction index across departments?

---

### DAX Calculations:
To dive deeper, I employed several DAX calculations to uncover meaningful insights:
1. **Attrition Rate**: I calculated the overall attrition rate by dividing the number of employees who left by the total workforce, arriving at a 16% attrition rate.
2. **Attrition by Department**: The highest attrition rates were found in the Research & Development (R&D) department, indicating a need for further investigation into the work culture there.
3. **Business Travel & Attrition**: Employees who rarely travel had a significantly higher attrition count (156 employees) than frequent travelers (69), suggesting that travel flexibility might be a retention factor.
4. **Average Age by Department**: The HR department had the highest average age, which may influence how work is structured.
5. **Satisfaction Index**: R&D reported the lowest satisfaction score at 2.73, highlighting areas for improvement.

In addition, the salary hike percentage was calculated to be **100%**, indicating that all employees had received a salary hike, though further analysis is needed to determine the distribution of those hikes.

### Key Findings

#### What is Working

- **Employee Retention in Certain Job Roles**: Some job roles, such as Research Directors, have significantly lower attrition rates. This might indicate higher job satisfaction or better alignment with company goals within these roles.

- **Salary Increases Across the Board**: All employees have received a salary hike, as indicated by the salary hike percentage calculated at 100%. This is a positive move that can contribute to employee satisfaction and loyalty.

  
#### What is Not Working

**High Attrition in R&D Department**: The R&D department shows the highest attrition rate, suggesting dissatisfaction or misalignment within this critical area. This high turnover rate could have implications for innovation and productivity.

- **Attrition Among Rarely Traveling Employees**: Employees who rarely travel for business show the highest turnover rates, indicating that travel frequency might be influencing job satisfaction or retention.
  
- **Low Satisfaction in Specific Departments**: The R&D department also scores the lowest in employee satisfaction, as shown by the Satisfaction Index. This low satisfaction is likely contributing to the high attrition rate within the department.
  
#### What Should Be Focused On

- **Enhancing Job Satisfaction in R&D**: Targeted interventions to improve satisfaction levels in the R&D department could help reduce turnover. This could include addressing workload, providing growth opportunities, and improving work-life balance.
  
- **Understanding the Impact of Business Travel**: The correlation between attrition and travel frequency warrants further investigation. Exploring how travel impacts employee experience could help in implementing policies that balance travel demands with employee well-being.
  
- **Focusing on Work-Life Balance Across Departments**: The scatter plot analysis shows how work-life balance influences job satisfaction across departments. Emphasizing flexible working conditions and personal time can boost job satisfaction and retention.

### Conclusion:

This analysis revealed that the R&D department needs to work on retaining employees, especially those who rarely travel. Improving work-life balance, increasing satisfaction, and tailoring HR policies to departments' unique needs could reduce attrition rates. These findings provide a solid foundation for strategic HR initiatives to enhance employee retention and overall workplace satisfaction.
